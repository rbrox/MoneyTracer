Solution: The solution we are going to provide 

Importing data: First, you will need to import your data into Python. You can use Python's built-in libraries like pandas or sqlite3 to read data from CSV, Excel, or SQL databases. For example, you can use the pandas library to read CSV files as follows:

If you have your data in a SQL database, you can use the sqlite3 library to read data as follows:


Data Cleaning: Once you have your data in Python, you may need to clean it up and prepare it for analysis. This can include handling missing or inconsistent data, removing duplicates, and encoding categorical data. You can use pandas or numpy libraries for data cleaning.

Data Analysis: Once your data is cleaned, you can use pandas and matplotlib libraries to explore and analyze it. You can visualize trends, correlations, and outliers to identify potential fraud patterns. For example, you can use pandas to group data by category and calculate aggregates as follows:


Fraud Tracing: Once you have identified potential fraud patterns, you can use scikit-learn library to build machine learning models for fraud detection. You can use supervised or unsupervised learning algorithms depending on your data and the type of fraud you want to detect. Some of the popular algorithms for fraud detection include logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. You can use scikit-learn's API to train and test your model as follows:


Reporting: Finally, you can use Python's libraries like ReportLab or PyPDF2 to generate reports summarizing your findings.
Note that this is a general outline, and the exact steps and libraries you use may depend on your specific data and requirements. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind data privacy and security concerns while handling sensitive financial data.




TO DO

- someone to helpme in coding alone this is crazy hard
- Someone rady to explore the various FRAUD TRACING ALGO and preefreebly suggest how to implement in python.
- someone to make a pictorial depiction of the db schema
- someone to document our reaserch, and prepare test data


STACK 

- Python and sqlite (db)
- Python and sci-kit (Fraud algo)
- Django (frontend)
